Simple Basic monitoring system

This basic monitoring system is to show the use of TCP Socket programming in python.

The Agent is running on the hosts we would like to monitor and collecting some data from the OS

The Server is running on one of the hosts and listening, waiting for a data to arrive.

Uppon arrival, the data is stored in MongoDB for later use.

On another Host, there is a WebAPP, showing the data that was collected in a graphical nice way.

Thank you.
